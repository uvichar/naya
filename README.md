•	An SQL script in the provided code produces several tables in a relational database. The attributes in each table, which each represent a different entity, explain the traits of that thing. 
•	Attributes like User_id, First_name, Last_name, Address, Age, Contact_no, and Email are contained in the "User" table. Users of a taxi service can have their information stored in this table.
•	Taxi_id, Registration_no, Model, Manufactured_year, Taxi_type, Status, and Owner_id are some of the elements in the "Taxi" table. Information on taxis, including their owners, can be kept in this table.
•	Attributes in the "Owner" table include Owner_id, SSN, Name, and Company_id. Information on the taxi proprietors can be kept in this table.
•	Attributes like Company_id, Tcs_id, and Tsc_name are contained in the "Company" table.
•	This is an SQL query that inserts data into a table called "Login". The table has columns named "User_id", "Login_id", "Password", "Credit_card_no", and "Balance". 

- The SELECT clause retrieves all columns from the "Bill" table.
- The WHERE clause specifies the conditions for the rows to retrieve. In this case, only the rows where "User_id" is 5678, "Driver_id" is 9012, and "Date" is the maximum date in the table will be retrieved. This means that the query will return the most recent bill for the specified user and driver.
Overall, these two queries work together to insert a new bill into the system for a specific trip, and then retrieve the most recent bill for a specified user and driver.
- The SELECT clause specifies the columns to retrieve and some computed values. The "Taxi_registration" column is the "Registration_no" column of the "Taxi" table. The "Taxi_model" column is the "Model" column of the "Taxi" table. "Total_trips" is the count of all taxi trips made with the taxi.

- The FROM clause specifies the tables to use for the query and the relationship between them. Two tables are joined: "Taxi" and "Trip". The "Taxi" and "Trip" tables are joined on their respective ID columns.

- The GROUP BY clause groups the result set by the taxi ID, which is the unique identifier of each taxi in the "Taxi" table. This means that the query will return one row per taxi, with the computed values aggregated over all taxi trips made with that taxi.
Overall, this query computes the total number of trips made by each taxi in the dataset, along with its registration number and model. By grouping the results by taxi, the query provides a summary of each taxi's activity in the system.


- The query retrieves data from two tables: "User" and "Trip".
- It joins the tables on their respective ID columns.
- The query groups the result set by user ID, first name, and last name.
- It computes the total amount spent on taxi trips by each user.
- The results are sorted in descending order of the total amount spent.
- The query returns one row per user, with the computed values aggregated over all taxi trips for that user.
